# discordt

discordt is a command-line interface for [discordapp](https://discordapp.com) using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) wrapper and curses.

Since Discord has yet to release an official API, anything could break at any point.

## Installation

Simply clone the repository, then run `pip install . -e` in the repository's directory.
